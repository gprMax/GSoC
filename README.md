# 🚀 gprMax @ Google Summer of Code

Welcome to the home of [gprMax](https://www.gprmax.com)'s [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) journey!

## Our GSoC Story

We're thrilled to have been selected for **GSoC2019, GSoC2021, GSoC2023, GSoC2024, and GSoC2025** — five amazing years of collaboration, innovation, and open-source excellence! 🎉

Our talented students have left their mark on gprMax. Their contributions have enriched our codebase, strengthened our community, and pushed the boundaries of what's possible with GPR simulation.

## Making Waves in the Research Community

The impact of our GSoC work extends beyond code. Our students have showcased their achievements on the international stage:
- **2 conference papers** presented at the [11th International Workshop on Advanced Ground Penetrating Radar](https://www.iwagpr2021.eu/) in Malta
- **Paper submission** to the [19th International Conference on Ground Penetrating Radar](https://learn.mines.edu/gpr2022/) in Colorado, USA
